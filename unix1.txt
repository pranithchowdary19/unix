UNIX:- It is an operating system. that created in 1960.

Charcteristics of UNIX:
-----------------------
1. It is a freeware.              - |
                                    |---(FOSS)-->Freeware and open source software.         
2. It is a open source software.  - |
3. It is multi user OS.
4. It is multi tasking OS.
5. It is user friendly and supports both CUI and GUI.
   CUI-->Command line interface.
   GUI-->Graphical user interface.
6. It is more secure than windows OS.

Flavous of UNIX:
---------------
-->As UNIX is open source operating system, multiple flavors are available with lot of extensions and improvements.
Eg:- Ubuntu, Redhat Linux,CentOS,Fedora,Kali,suse ETC.

Components of UNIX:- There are two types of components.
-------------------
1. Shell
2. Kernel


1. Shell:
--------
--> It is an outer layer of UNIX OS.
--> The user can communicate with shell only.
--> Shell reads the command provided by user.
--> Shell will verify is it vaild command or not.
--> if everything is fine,then shell converts that command into kernel understandable form and handover to kernel.
-->Shell acts as interface between user and kernel.

2. Kernel:
---------
--> It is core component of UNIX OS.
--> It is reponsible to execute our commands with the help of hardware components.
--> it is responsible for memory allocation and processor allocation.
--> it acts as interface between shell and hardware components.

Command Exection Flow:
----------------------
1. Normal user ---> $ prompt.
2. Super user or Root user ---> # prompt.

sudo -i ---> this command is used to switch to super user.

Basic commands:
--------------
1.  pwd   --> It shows current working directory.(print working directory)
2.  ls    --> It listout all files and directories.
3.  mkdir --> To create a working directory.
4.  cd    --> Change directory.
5.  touch --> To create a empty file.
6.  rmdir --> To remove directory.
7.  rm    --> To remove a file.
8.  cal   --> To display current month calender.
9.  date  --> Display current date and time.
10. help  --> It will listout available commands.
11. clear --> To clear the terminal.
12. exit  --> To logout session.
13. hello --> To display brief system information.


LINUX FILE SYSTEM:
------------------
-->Types of files in linux:- there are three types of files.
   -----------------------
**In linux everything is treated as file.
1. Normal files
2. Directory files
3. Device files

1. Normal files:- These files contains data. it can be a normal files or binary files(image,video,audio files etc).
2. Directory file:- These files represent directories.
                 -->Directory contains files and sub directories.
3.Device files:- In linux every device is represented as a file. every device means terminal,motherboard and etc.
              -->tty to represent the terminals.
	      -->to communicate with other terminals we use this
	      -->echo "message" > /dev/pty1
              --> (>)---> this symbol represents the output redirections.

	      -->mv command is used to rename the file.
	      Eg:- mv unix1.txt unix.sh
-->in linux there is a file command to check file type.
Syntax:- file filename---->it tells file type.
Eg:- file unix1.

How to check file types:
-----------------------
--> in ubuntu blue colour files represents directories.


-->To know the file type we use this command.
Eg:- ls -l
--> -l means long listing.

-->The first charcter represents the type of file.
1. d---> it means directory file.
2. (-)--> it means normal file.
3. l --> it means link file.
4. c --> charcter special file.
5. b --> block special file.
6. s --> socket file.


--> ls -a----> to listout all files including hidden files.
--> (-a)--> it means all.
--> every directory contains two hidden directories.
  1. (.)---> represents current directory.
  2. (..)---> represents parent directory.
  3. (cd ~)---> it switches user home directory.


Linux File System Hierarchy:
----------------------------
--> Linux file system has TREE like structure.
--> it starts with root directory (/).
-->(/--->root directory)--is a topmost directory.

1. Bin directory:
-----------------
--> BIN means binary.
--> bin directory contains all binary executables related to our linux commands.

2. Sbin directory:
-----------------
--> Sbin means system-bin or secondary-bin.
-->Sbin commands are used by super user only.
-->Normal user uses commands related to binary executables files available in bin directory.
-->Super user uses commands related to binary executables files available in bin directory.

Diff b/w bin and sbin:
----------------------
** Bin contains binary executable related commands used by normal user.
** Sbin contains binary executable related commands used by super user.

3. ETC directory:
-----------------
--> This directory contains all system configurations.
--> These configurations are used by operating system itself.
Eg:- cd /etc
     cat passwd--->it shows all user information
     cat hosts--->it shows all hosts information.

4. Tmp directory:
-----------------
--> tmp means temporary
--> if any file are directory required for temporary purpose in our current session and these files will we deleted 
automatically at the time of system shut down.

5. Dev directory:
-----------------
--> Dev means device.
-->Every device in linux is treated as file.
-->All these device related files will be stored inside dev directory.
-->By using these files we can communicate with that devices.

Eg:- 1. tty----> terminal related file.
     2. fd ----> flopy drive related file.
     3. hd ----> hard disk related file.
     4. ram ---> ram related file.
     5. stdin---> standard input device file(keyboard).
     6.stdout---> standard output device(terminal,monitor).
     7.stderr---> standard error device(terminal,monitor).

6. mnt directory:
-----------------
-->mnt means mounting.
-->mnt directory contains files which is available because of manual mounting.

7. Media directory:
-------------------
-->The files of automatic mounting will be placed inside media directory.

diff b/w mnt and media directories:
-----------------------------------
-->mnt-----> contains manual mounting files.
-->media---> contains automatic mounting files.

8. opt directory:
-----------------
-->opt means optional
-->This directory contains all third party software installation files.

9. lib directory:
-----------------
-->lib means library.
-->this libraries which are required by our commands and applications.

10. var directory:
-----------------
-->var means variable data.
-->if any data which is keep on changing such type of variable data will be stored inside var directory.
Eg:- log files.

11. usr directory:
------------------
--> usr means user.
--> this directory contains all user related softwares.

12. home directory:
-------------------
-->As linux is a multi user operating system.
-->All these user directories will be stored inside the home directory.

13. proc directory:
------------------
-->proc means process.
-->in linux multiple processes running simultaneously. for each process a unique id will be there : pid.

14. boot directory:
-------------------
-->the files which are required to boot linux os.
