UNIX:- It is an operating system. that created in 1960.

Charcteristics of UNIX:
-----------------------
1. It is a freeware.              - |
                                    |---(FOSS)-->Freeware and open source software.         
2. It is a open source software.  - |
3. It is multi user OS.
4. It is multi tasking OS.
5. It is user friendly and supports both CUI and GUI.
   CUI-->Command line interface.
   GUI-->Graphical user interface.
6. It is more secure than windows OS.

Flavous of UNIX:
---------------
-->As UNIX is open source operating system, multiple flavors are available with lot of extensions and improvements.
Eg:- Ubuntu, Redhat Linux,CentOS,Fedora,Kali,suse ETC.

Components of UNIX:- There are two types of components.
-------------------
1. Shell
2. Kernel


1. Shell:
--------
--> It is an outer layer of UNIX OS.
--> The user can communicate with shell only.
--> Shell reads the command provided by user.
--> Shell will verify is it vaild command or not.
--> if everything is fine,then shell converts that command into kernel understandable form and handover to kernel.
-->Shell acts as interface between user and kernel.

2. Kernel:
---------
--> It is core component of UNIX OS.
--> It is reponsible to execute our commands with the help of hardware components.
--> it is responsible for memory allocation and processor allocation.
--> it acts as interface between shell and hardware components.

Command Exection Flow:
----------------------
1. Normal user ---> $ prompt.
2. Super user or Root user ---> # prompt.

sudo -i ---> this command is used to switch to super user.

Basic commands:
--------------
1.  pwd   --> It shows current working directory.(print working directory)
2.  ls    --> It listout all files and directories.
3.  mkdir --> To create a working directory.
4.  cd    --> Change directory.
5.  touch --> To create a empty file.
6.  rmdir --> To remove directory.
7.  rm    --> To remove a file.
8.  cal   --> To display current month calender.
9.  date  --> Display current date and time.
10. help  --> It will listout available commands.
11. clear --> To clear the terminal.
12. exit  --> To logout session.
13. hello --> To display brief system information.


LINUX FILE SYSTEM:
------------------
-->Types of files in linux:- there are three types of files.
   -----------------------
**In linux everything is treated as file.
1. Normal files
2. Directory files
3. Device files

1. Normal files:- These files contains data. it can be a normal files or binary files(image,video,audio files etc).
2. Directory file:- These files represent directories.
                 -->Directory contains files and sub directories.
3.Device files:- In linux every device is represented as a file. every device means terminal,motherboard and etc.
              -->tty to represent the terminals.
	      -->to communicate with other terminals we use this
	      -->echo "message" > /dev/pty1
              --> (>)---> this symbol represents the output redirections.

	      -->mv command is used to rename the file.
	      Eg:- mv unix1.txt unix.sh
-->in linux there is a file command to check file type.
Syntax:- file filename---->it tells file type.
Eg:- file unix1.

How to check file types:
-----------------------
--> in ubuntu blue colour files represents directories.


-->To know the file type we use this command.
Eg:- ls -l
--> -l means long listing.

-->The first charcter represents the type of file.
1. d---> it means directory file.
2. (-)--> it means normal file.
3. l --> it means link file.
4. c --> charcter special file.
5. b --> block special file.
6. s --> socket file.
